# Western-Game

<h2>Motivation:</h2> 
Western Game is my first original project to get graduaded programming bootcamp 'CodersLab'. It is a browser game. Technologies what i used is: HTML5, CSS, SASS, JAVASCRIPT, ES6, REACT, WEBPACK. Game was prepared as a desktop version. In the future i plan to expand this basic version for RWD and add three or four more levels with different difficulties. Afterwards i want make posibility to choose two options to play. One is standard game with three or four levels and second ranking game where players can rivalise each other to make more points. Create this game gave me a lot of problems to solve but also huge fun!

<h2>Below is a short introdution when you open the game:</h2>
"You are the last man stand who can free a city from evil bastards. You must kill 50 opponents to reach the goal. Be careful, the city is so big that you can't see all the buildings. You have to look around. Bandits can hide everywhere. Every time they want to shoot you, they must reload their weapons and have some time to aim at you. So... when you hear that, you can be sure that a bastard has appeared for shoot down. It is speedy observation game so you should be focus. Good luck!"
